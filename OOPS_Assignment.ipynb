        "**Question-4)** What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer-4)**\n",
        "\n",
        "Abstraction and encapsulation are two fundamental concepts in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that often get confused because they both involve \"hiding\" details. However, they serve different purposes and operate at different levels.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's a breakdown of the key differences:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Abstraction** :-\n",
        "i) Focuses on \"what\" an object does. Abstraction is about simplifying complex systems by showing only the necessary and essential features to the user, while hiding the complex implementation details.\n",
        "\n",
        "ii) Solves problems at the design or interface level. It's about designing a clear, high-level interface that a user can interact with without needing to know the inner workings.\n",
        "\n",
        "iii) Real-world analogy: Think of a car's dashboard. We, the driver, use the steering wheel, pedals, and gear shift to control the car. We don't need to know how the engine, transmission, or fuel system work to drive. The dashboard is the abstraction—it provides a simple interface to a complex machine.\n",
        "\n",
        "iv) In Python: Abstraction is often implemented using Abstract Base Classes (ABCs) from the abc module. An ABC defines a common interface and abstract methods that must be implemented by any concrete subclass. This enforces a specific structure and ensures that subclasses adhere to a certain contract.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Encapsulation** :-\n",
        "i) Focuses on \"how\" an object does something. Encapsulation is the practice of bundling data (attributes) and the methods that operate on that data into a single unit (a class). It's about protecting the data from outside interference and misuse.\n",
        "\n",
        "ii) Solves problems at the implementation level. It's a mechanism for data hiding, where the internal state of an object is kept private and can only be accessed or modified through controlled methods (often called \"getters\" and \"setters\").\n",
        "\n",
        "iii) Real-world analogy: Think of a smartphone. All the components—the battery, the processor, the screen, the memory—are bundled together inside the phone's case. You can't directly access or change these components. We interact with them through a well-defined interface, like the operating system and apps. This bundling and protection of internal data is encapsulation.\n",
        "\n",
        "iv) In Python: Python achieves encapsulation through a convention of using special naming conventions. A single leading underscore (_) is a convention to indicate a \"protected\" member (intended for internal use by the class and its subclasses), while a double leading underscore (__) makes a member \"private\" by name mangling, making it harder to access from outside the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "**In Summary:**\n",
        "Abstraction simplifies complexity by focusing only on the important things — it hides how something works.\n",
        "\n",
        "Encapsulation protects the internal state by controlling who can access or modify data, and how they do it.\n",
        "\n",
        "While abstraction is about designing clean interfaces, encapsulation is about safeguarding data and enforcing rules around its use. Both help make code more secure, modular, and easier to manage.\n"

        "1. Extending, Not Replacing, Parent Class Functionality\n",
        "The primary use of super() is to call a method from a parent class that has been overridden in the child class. This allows you to extend the functionality of the parent's method rather than completely replacing it.\n",

The function will automatically adapt to the new MRO, making your code more robust and easier to refactor.\n",

        "**Question-23)** How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer-23)**\n",
        "\n",
        "Polymorphism in Python, when combined with inheritance, allows you to write code that can work with objects of different classes that are related through a common base class. The core idea is that a method call behaves differently depending on the specific type of object it is called on.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's how it works, broken down by key concepts:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Method Overriding\n",
        "The foundation of polymorphism with inheritance is method overriding. This is where a subclass provides its own specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass.\n",
        "\n",
        "Parent Class (Base Class): A base class defines a general method. For example, an Animal class might have a generic speak() method.\n",
        "\n",
        "Child Classes (Subclasses): Child classes inherit from the base class and override the speak() method to provide their unique behavior. A Dog class will make the speak() method print \"Woof!\", while a Cat class will make it print \"Meow!\".\n",
        "\n",
        "The method signature (name and parameters) must be the same in both the parent and child classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. The Shared Interface\n",
        "Even though each subclass has a different implementation of the speak() method, they all share the same public interface. This means that a function or a piece of code that expects an Animal object can call its speak() method without needing to know if the object is specifically a Dog or a Cat.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Duck Typing\n",
        "Python's polymorphism is often referred to as \"duck typing.\" The principle is: \"If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it's a duck.\" In programming terms, if an object has a certain method, you can call that method on it, regardless of its class type.\n",
        "\n",
        "This allows you to create code that is not dependent on the class hierarchy, but on the presence of specific methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example\n",
        "Let's put these concepts together with a concrete example."

        "**Common Use Cases**\n",
        "\n",
        "The __call__ method is useful in several scenarios:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Stateful Functions: When you need a function that remembers or holds some state between calls. This is a powerful alternative to using global variables or closures. The object's attributes store the state, and __call__ performs the action.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Decorators: The __call__ method is a key component in creating class-based decorators. A decorator class's __init__ method can store the decorator's parameters, and the __call__ method can then wrap the function it is decorating.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Function Factories: When you need to generate functions with slightly different behaviors. A class can act as a factory, and its instances (created with __init__) become the customized functions.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Simulating APIs: It can be used to create a clean and intuitive API, where a class instance represents a service, and calling the instance performs its primary action. For example, a Logger object could be called directly to log a message.\n",
        "\n",
        "In essence, __call__ is a tool for creating callable objects. It allows you to encapsulate data and behavior within a class and then use that object with the simple, familiar syntax of a function call."
